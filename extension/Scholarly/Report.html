            WeDI is a Chrome extension whose purpose is to detect and extract schemas requested by the user. These schemas come written
            in the RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD HTML5 language extensions. As such, this extension will detect all these formats.

        <p>
            Initially, the project started slow, given that we misunderstood the requirements. We started on the wrong foot, but as we
            spoke with the professor, things became clearer and the project progressed fast. We split the tasks equally and
            made sure we coded in the same style, to avoid creating unnecessary confusion when integrating each part of the
            project.

            <span>3. </span>Project Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The project was written using VanillaJS, HTML5 and CSS3. Each functionality is in its own .js file, for modularity. The extension
            injects these scripts in the current tab, to access the DOM we wish to process. Upon finding a schema, the function
            transforms it into JSON-LD, and added to a list of JSON's which is returned by the tab to the extension. Lastly,
            the extension displays each JSON.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <span>4. </span>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            The extension was tested on various sites, as well as self made pages, to make sure the functions worked correctly and outputted
            the expected results. Some of the tested pages are:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a property="url" href="https://www.corido.co.uk/">Corido</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a property="url" href="https://www.facebook.com/NuDoarOPauzadeCafea/">Fika</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a property="url" href="https://schema.org/Movie">Schema.org</a>
                </li>
            </ol>
            These pages contains either JSON-LD, RDFa, Microdata, or combinations of them.
