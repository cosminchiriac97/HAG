            WeDI is a Chrome extension whose purpose is to detect and extract schemas requested by the user. These schemas come written
            in the RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD HTML5 language extensions. As such, this extension will detect all these formats.

        <h2>
            <span>2. </span>Project Progress</h2>
        <p>
            Initially, the project started slow, given that we misunderstood the requirements. We started on the wrong foot, but as we
            spoke with the professor, things became clearer and the project progressed fast. We split the tasks equally and
            made sure we coded in the same style, to avoid creating unnecessary confusion when integrating each part of the
            project.

    <section id="architecture">
        <h2>
            <span>3. </span>Project Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The project was written using VanillaJS, HTML5 and CSS3. Each functionality is in its own .js file, for modularity. The extension
            injects these scripts in the current tab, to access the DOM we wish to process. Upon finding a schema, the function
            transforms it into JSON-LD, and added to a list of JSON's which is returned by the tab to the extension. Lastly,
            the extension displays each JSON in tables, each depth being highlighted with a different color (a legend of
            that is shown in the settings tab).
            <div>
                <h3>
                    <span>3.1 </span>Splitting the project</h3>
                <p>
                    We split the project in 3 main parts: parsing the DOM for RDFa and transforming it into JSON-LD, parsing the DOM for Microdata
                    and transforming it into JSON-LD, and the front-end part which included parsing JSON-LD's. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    <span>3.2 </span>RDFa</h3>
                <p>
                    To parse the DOM for RDFa, we used a recursive algorithm which searches for the elements annotated with "typeof". The element
                    is then checked for properties, and then processed accordingly. The algorithm then goes further to the
                    processed element's children.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    <span>3.3 </span>JSON-LD</h3>
                <p>
                    For the JSON-LD parsing we use quite an easy approach. We simply extract the
                    <b>script</b> tagged elements, we filter them by their type ("application/ld+json"), and then we just parse
                    the inner JSONs. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    <span>3.4 </span>Microdata</h3>
                <p>
                    The extract method is very similar to the RDFa one. The algorithm iterates thru the DOM in search for the specified types,
                    once he founds it, then it recursively collects data further in order to create ultimately, a json. All the JSON-LDs generated
                    are sent to the extention's script that transforms it into a table in the user interface.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    <span>3.5 </span>Exports</h3>
                <p>
                    All the resulted data after scrapping a webpage accordingly to the user's filters can be exported as either one of the formats ( Microdata,
                    JSON-LD and RDFa). For both Microdata and RDFa there is a script for each one that receives a JSON-LD and parses it into a HTML file, or 
                    straight JSON.

            The extension was tested on various sites, as well as self made pages, to make sure the functions worked correctly and outputted
